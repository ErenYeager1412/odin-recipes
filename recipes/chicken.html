    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 thigh, bone removeds chicken thighs </li>
        <li> 2 cups dill pickle juice </li>
        <li> 1 cup vegetable oil for frying </li>
        <li> 1 cup buttermilk </li>
        <li> 1 cup all-purpose flour </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li> Â¾ teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken thighs in a resealable plastic bag; cover with pickle juice. Seal and refrigerate for 3 hours.
        </li>
        <li>Drain pickle juice from thighs. Cover chicken; refrigerate until ready to fry.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>Heat 2 inches oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>Pour buttermilk and flour into 2 separate bowls. Season flour with salt and pepper. Dredge chicken in
            buttermilk. Toss in flour. Return to buttermilk and toss in flour a second time. Place chicken on a rack set
            over a baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>Fill Dutch oven with as many thighs as possible without crowding. Cook at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)
            until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Place thighs on the baking sheet. Repeat until all pieces are
            fried. Transfer thighs to the oven.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 8 minutes. An
            instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Season
            with a pinch of salt.
        </li>
    </ol>
